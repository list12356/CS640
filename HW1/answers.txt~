Question 2:

prediction:
The latency should be the sum of the L1 and L2 and L3, according to the previous measurement, the delay should be approximately 160ms

The throughput should be the smallest bandwidth in L1 L2 and L3, that is 20Mbps

measured:
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.319/161.396/170.130/2.345 ms
received=57285KB rate=18.32Mbps
sent=56888KB rate=22.752Mbps

Question 3:

prediction:
for two pairs:
The latency should be the sum of the L1 and L2 and L3, according to the previous measurement, the delay should be approximately 160ms

The throughput should be the half of the thoughput in Q2, which is approximately the half of 20Mbps, that is approximately 10Mbps

for three pairs:
the latency should be the same, approximately 160ms.

the throughput should all be one third od 20Mbps, that is approximately 6.67Mbps

Measurement:
for two pairs:
the latency between h1h4 and h7h9 is
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.233/160.799/170.892/1.553 ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.272/160.781/169.382/1.304 ms

the throughput between h1h4 and h7h9 is 
sent=31585KB rate=12.632Mbps
sent=24163KB rate=9.664Mbps

for three pairs:
latency:
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.235/160.984/169.387/2.081 ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.221/161.184/171.110/2.457 ms
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.353/161.419/172.581/2.844 ms
throughput:
sent=54427KB rate=7.256Mbps
sent=49172KB rate=6.552Mbps
sent=48903KB rate=6.52Mbps

Question 4:

prediction:
the latency between h1 and h4 should be the sum of L1, L2 and L3160ms
and the latency between h5 and h6 should be the sum of L4 L2 and L5, that is 30ms

the throughput congestion only happened in L2, thus the throughput for h1 h4 should be min(L1,L2/2,L3) that is 20Mbps, and the throughput betweenh5 and h6 should be min(L4,L2/2,L5), which is also 20Mbps

measured:
h1h4:
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 160.354/161.217/168.002/1.884 ms
sent=49913KB rate=19.96Mbps
h5-h6
rtt min/avg/max/mdev = 40.223/41.251/50.833/2.401 ms
sent=49101KB rate=19.64Mbps
